    <h2>What is a table</h2>
    <p>A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). <br>
     A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind <br>
     of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age,<br>
      or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.</p>


    <h2>How does a table work?</h2>
      <p>The point of a table is that it is rigid. Information is easily interpreted by making <br>
        visual associations between row and column headers. Look at the table below for example <br>
        and find a Jovian gas giant with 62 moons. You can find the answer by associating the <br>
        relevant row and column headers.</p>

        <h2>Table styling</h2>
    <p>Be under no illusion; for tables to be effective on the web, you need to provide some styling <br>
        information with CSS, as well as good solid structure with HTML. In this module we are focusing <br>
        on the HTML part; to find out about the CSS part you should visit our Styling tables article after
         you've finished here.</p>
