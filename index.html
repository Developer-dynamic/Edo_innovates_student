    <br> and two
    paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; in this exercise. As the texts in the

        Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new
file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same folder where your first .html is. After
you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load
another_page.html when you click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. You need to use the
&lt;a&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags in this exercise. Inside the tag &lt;a&gt; you need to use a href attribute that specifies
which page will be loaded when the link is clicked.

    <h1>Question 8</h1>
    <p>
        HTML tags like &lt;a&gt; can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the &lt;a&gt; tag.
            Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse
            cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in
            the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is
            over the link.

    <h1>Question 9</h1>
